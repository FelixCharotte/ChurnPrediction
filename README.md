# **Customer Churn Prediction for SME Segment - BCG Consulting Project**

## **Project Context**

This project addresses the churn problem for the SME segment of a major gas 
and electricity utility in Europe. Due to the power-liberalization of the energy 
market, the client faced significant customer attrition and engaged in predictive 
analytics to identify high-risk customers and reduce churn through strategic discounting.


## **Objective**

1. Predict SME customers with a high likelihood of churning.  
2. Validate the hypothesis that price sensitivity drives churn.  
3. Support a 20% discount strategy to retain high-risk customers.


## **Approach and Methodology**
# 1. Data Analysis:

- Processed a dataset of 10,000 SME customers.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis with 8 visualizations to uncover churn trends.


# 2. Feature Engineering:

- Analyzed 16 critical features for model optimization.  
- Used R-sampling to address class imbalance.


# 3. Model Development:

- Built a predictive churn model using Random Forest achieving an accuracy of 84%.
- Analyzed feature importance to identify drivers of churn.


# 4. Strategic Insights:

- Provided predictions for at-risk customers.
- Supported targeted discounting strategies based on predictive results.


## **Results**
# Accuracy: 

84% using Random Forest Classifier.


# Key Insights:

Identified price sensitivity and critical churn drivers, validating the client's hypothesis.


## **Technologies Used**

- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn).
- Random Forest Classifier for predictions.
- Visualizations and feature importance analysis for actionable insights.


## **Conclusion**

This project provided a data-driven predictive model, enabling the client to effectively 
implement a 20% discount strategy to mitigate churn in their SME customer segment.
